# 42 Libft

This repository showcases my implementation of a custom standard C library (libft) for the 42 School curriculum.<br>
This library will be used in my future 42 assignments.<br>
During this project, I honed my skills in memory management, string manipulation, and gained a deeper understanding of C fundamentals.

## Key Features

- Reimplementation of commonly used standard C library functions.
- Adherence to the 42 School's coding standards (Norm).
- Well-documented codebase for easy comprehension and future modifications.

## Structure
The project is divided into the following parts:

Standard Library Functions: Reimplementations of commonly used functions.
Additional Assignment Functions: Functions designed to enhance functionality and code readability.
Bonus List Functions:
Other Functions: Additional functions seperate to the assignment I have since added to my library.

## Example Usage

## Makefile Commands for Integration
`make` to compile library<br>
`make clean` to remove object files<br>
`make fclean` to delete library file<br>
`make re` to recompile library<br>
